# IndabaX Rwanda at ICLR 2023

 IndabaX is a locally-organized gathering that helps develop knowledge and capacity in machine learning and artificial intelligence in individual countries across Africa. Initiated by the Deep Learning Indaba, it is a means to experiment with the ways in which African machine learning and its local communities can be strengthened beyond the annual. 

 This year's IndabaX Rwanda will be collocated with ICLR as one of the conference's workshops. The event will host speakers working in the local and regional Machine Learning fields, panel discussions on topics that interest the community, and spotlight presentations and poster sessions from work being done by Machine Learning and AI researchers in Rwanda.


## Call for Papers

Applications for attending and presenting research works in IndabaX Rwanda are open. We encourage completed research, short papers & extended abstracts for posters & highlight presentations representing the Rwandan research community.
